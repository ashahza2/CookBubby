A stock pot of boiling water does double-duty (we love that kind of efficiency, don’t you?) and simple ingredients come together to make a healthy, satisfying supper everyone can feel good about. Oh yeah, that’s the stuff. Here’s how to make this easy, healthy pasta recipe:Prep all of your broccoli pesto ingredients—rinse the basil leaves, grate your Parmigiano, peel your garlic.Bring a big pot of salted water to a boil. Boil the broccoli. After two minutes, remove the florets, and add your pasta.While the pasta cooks, make the pesto! Blend the broccoli, basil, garlic, pine nuts, extra virgin olive oil, salt and parmigiano reggiano until it’s nice and smooth.When the pasta is done, scoop out a cup of that liquid gold (aka pasta water) and add it slowly to the pesto as you blend it a bit more.  Toss the pasta with the broccoli pesto and dig in!"},

The key is coating the lemon chicken with lots of moisture-giving things, and watching that internal temp closely so that you don’t over-bake the chicken. Make a lemon chicken marinade. Well, it’s really more like a rub or a paste, because our lemon chicken recipe requires no actual marinating (yay!). But basically, we coat the chicken breasts in a thick, olive oil-based herb paste flavored with oregano, thyme, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Make the lemon chicken sauce! Stir together all of the zingy things—white wine, fresh garlic, lemon zest, lemon juice—to make the sauce that the chicken breasts will bake in. You’ll also use this sauce to baste the chicken as it bakes, ensuring that these bright flavors have a chance to be absorbed by the chicken (without having to actually marinate the chicken). Bake! Until you get that internal temperature reading of 165°F. Then it’s time to dig in"},
